<h1>User Manual for Pantterilasku</h1>
<br><h2>User Interface description</h2>
The main UI screen has two large tables; <b>"customer"</b>, <b>"Invoices"</b> and a text-input field <b>"Email Text"</b>.
<br>
<br>The upper <b>"customer"</b> table has a list of team members so that each member has an activation checkbox for 1 to 6 invoice items and a dropdown box for due date as the last item. On the header row of the table there are power selectors that affect the checkboxes on all rows below.
<br>After each selection checkbox there is an item count dropdown box that activates when the said selection ox is checked. The item count selector defines how many of the said invoice items are to be billed, for example "2 t-shirts".
<br>Selection checkbox and item count dropdown:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp<input type="checkbox"> <select><option value="1">1</option><option value="2">2</option><option value="3">3</option><option value="4">4</option><option value="5">5</option><option value="6">6</option><option value="7">7</option><option value="8">8</option><option value="9">9</option></select>
<br>
<br>The lower <b>"Invoices"</b> table defines the invoice tiems that can be selected for each customer. For each billing session you can select 1 to 6 items, in any mix to the customers.
<br>
<br>When you start planning invoices, it is best to first select from the <b>"Invoices"</b> table such items that are to be billed from all the customers you want to send bills to, if such items exist; for example team membership fees. That kind of item should be selected in the uppermost invoice table row. After that when you click the first power selection box in the <b>"customer"</b> table all customers will have this item on their invoice.
<br>If you only want to bill some items from a subset of the team members, only select the checkboxes of those customers from each cloumn.
<br>
<br><h2>Preview of invoices</h2>
When you have selected one or more billable items for a customer in the <b>"customer"</b> table, on each row that has selections will have an activated preview link in the end: <a href="#">Preview PDF</a>
<br>By clicking the preview link a new tab will open in your browser where an exact preview copy of the to-be-sent invoice is generated in PDF format. If your browser settings prevent opening new tabs, you will probably get a notification popup saying so.
<br><i>NOTE! It is possible that this doesn't work correctly in Microsoft Edge browser. This has been tested to work only in Firefox and Chrome browsers.</i>
<br>

all customers are sent an email which has their personal invoice PDF attached.
<br>When the invoices have been sent, a zipfile containing all the invoices is uploaded to your browser, to be saved or viewed at will.
<br>
<br><h2>Downloading the invoices</h2>
If you do not want to automatically email the invoices but rather print and hand them out directly or send via snailmail, you can download the invoices as zipfile by clicking the button <button type="button">Download Invoice Zipfile!</button>
